# dev-tools-mess-state
Not sure if it should behave like that

The counter is the example app of redux.

## setup

`npm install`

open the console in the browser and increment, do you see as well that the `console.log` statement is "adding up"
the more the increment button is pressed? 

Is this a bug of redux-devools or the desired behavior?
